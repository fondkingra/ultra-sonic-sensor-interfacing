# Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to interface an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino Uno microcontroller board to measure distances accurately. Ultrasonic sensors are widely used in various applications such as robotics, home automation, and industrial control systems for distance measurement, object detection, and obstacle avoidance.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno: The Arduino Uno is the main microcontroller board used in this project. It serves as the brain of the system, processing data from the ultrasonic sensor and controlling its operation.
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is a popular and inexpensive sensor module capable of measuring distances accurately using ultrasonic waves.
- Jumper Wires: Jumper wires are used to establish electrical connections between the Arduino Uno and the ultrasonic sensor.

## Circuit Connection

To set up the circuit, follow these steps:

1. Connect the VCC pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno.
2. Connect the GND pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno.
3. Connect the Trigger pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 2 of the Arduino Uno.
4. Connect the Echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pin 3 of the Arduino Uno.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
3. Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
4. Open the `ultrasonic_sensor.ino` file from the downloaded repository in the Arduino IDE.
5. Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded to the Arduino board, follow these steps to use the ultrasonic sensor:

1. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
2. You will see the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor displayed in centimeters (cm).
3. Place objects in front of the sensor and observe the changes in distance readings.
4. Experiment with different distances and observe how the sensor responds.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or usage of the ultrasonic sensor, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Check the connections between the ultrasonic sensor and the Arduino Uno to ensure they are properly connected.
- Verify that the code uploaded to the Arduino board is correct and error-free.
- Ensure that the power supply to the Arduino board is stable and within the operating voltage range of the components used.
